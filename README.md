# uPython-
Hello Every one!

This repository is where I put my uPython code for testing in esp32-cam board

In this moment I'm testing the camera and SD memory module to take images and save them in .jpg format. Before to see the examples I recomend to you read the Setup information and every thing you need in Visual Studio Code to write, complie and run your programs.
